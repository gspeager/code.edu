Created as a Reusable Learning Object for a university project.

The goal is to create an interactive website to teach programming to beginners.  The site is based around an interactive javascript console which can execute code using the javascript `eval()` function. Each lessonX.html covers a specific topic while the advanced.html statically covers topics which would be hard to do using the console as the sole tool.  The lessons are currently:

1. Mathematical Operators
2. Strings
3. Comparisons
4. Variables
5. Arrays

Even though there is no database or server-side code in this project, I attempted to follow Don't Repeat Yourself principles so that creating a server-side code, and data driven pages would not be hard.

This project uses the Twitter [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for base CSS and UI javascript and google [Prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) for syntax highlighting.
